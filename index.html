            <p>The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960, comprising John Lennon,
                Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. They are regarded as the most influential
                band of all time[1] and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and the recognition
                of popular music as an art form.[2] Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock 'n' roll, their sound
                incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways. The band also explored
                music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording,
                songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionized many aspects of the music industry and
                were often publicized as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.</p>
            <p> Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, the
                Quarrymen,
                and built their reputation by playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg, Germany, over three years from
                1960, initially
                with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since
                1958, went through
                a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before inviting Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian
                Epstein moulded
                them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly
                expanding their domestic success after they signed with EMI Records and achieved their first hit, "Love
                Me Do", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed "Beatlemania", the
                band acquired the nickname "the Fab Four". Epstein, Martin or another member of the band's entourage was
                sometimes informally referred to as a "fifth Beatle".</p>
            <p>By early 1964, the Beatles were international stars and had achieved unprecedented levels of critical and
                commercial
                success. They became a leading force in Britain's cultural resurgence, ushering in the British Invasion
                of the United
                States pop market. They soon made their film debut with A Hard Day's Night (1964). A growing desire to
                refine their
                studio efforts, coupled with the challenging nature of their concert tours, led to the band's retirement
                from live performances in 1966. During this time, they produced albums of greater sophistication,
                including Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). They
                enjoyed further commercial success with The Beatles (also known as "the White Album", 1968) and Abbey
                Road (1969). The success of these records heralded the album era, as albums became the dominant form of
                record use over singles. These records also increased public interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern
                spirituality and furthered advancements in electronic music, album art and music videos. In 1968, they
                founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to
                the band's legacy. After the group's break-up in 1970, all principal former members enjoyed success as
                solo artists, and some partial reunions occurred. Lennon was murdered in 1980, and Harrison died of lung
                cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.</p>

            <p> The Beatles are the best-selling music act of all time, with estimated sales of 600 million units
                worldwide.
                They are the most successful act in the history of the US Billboard charts,
                holding the record for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart
                , most number-one hits on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart
                , and most singles sold in the UK (21.9 million). The band received many accolades,
                including seven Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original
                Song Score for the 1970 documentary film Let It Be) and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards.
                They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility,
                1988, and each principal member was individually inducted between 1994 and 2015. In 2004 and 2011,
                the group topped Rolling Stone's lists of the greatest artists in history. Time magazine named them
                among the 20th century's 100 most important people.</p>

        <article>
            <p>Former Rolling Stone magazine associate editor Robert Greenfield compared the Beatles to Picasso, as
                "artists who broke through the constraints of their time period to come up with something that was
                unique and original ... [I]n the form of popular music, no one will ever be more revolutionary, more
                creative and more distinctive ..."The British poet Philip Larkin described their work as "an
                enchanting and intoxicating hybrid of Negro rock-and-roll with their own adolescent romanticism" and
                "the first advance in popular music since the War".</p>

            <P> In 1964, the Beatles' arrival in the U.S. is credited with initiating the album era; the music historian
                Joel Whitburn says that LP sales soon "exploded and eventually outpaced the sales and releases of
                singles" in the music industry.They not only sparked the British Invasion of the US,[438] they became a
                globally influential phenomenon as well. From the 1920s, the US had dominated popular entertainment
                culture throughout much of the world, via Hollywood films, jazz, the music of Broadway and Tin Pan
                Alley, and later, the rock and roll that first emerged in Memphis, Tennessee. The Beatles are
                regarded as British cultural icons, with young adults from abroad naming the band among a group of
                people whom they most associated with UK culture.</P>

            <P> Their musical innovations and commercial success inspired musicians worldwide.Many artists have
                acknowledged the Beatles' influence and enjoyed chart success with covers of their songs. On radio,
                their arrival marked the beginning of a new era; in 1968 the programme director of New York's WABC radio
                station forbade his DJs from playing any "pre-Beatles" music, marking the defining line of what would be
                considered oldies on American radio. They helped to redefine the album as something more than just
                a few hits padded out with "filler",and they were primary innovators of the modern music
                video. The Shea Stadium show with which they opened their 1965 North American tour attracted an
                estimated 55,600 people, then the largest audience in concert history; Spitz describes the event as a
                "major breakthrough ... a giant step toward reshaping the concert business" .Emulation of their
                clothing and especially their hairstyles, which became a mark of rebellion, had a global impact on
                fashion.</P>

            <P> According to Gould, the Beatles changed the way people listened to popular music and experienced its
                role in their lives. From what began as the Beatlemania fad, the group's popularity grew into what was
                seen as an embodiment of sociocultural movements of the decade. As icons of the 1960s counterculture,
                Gould continues, they became a catalyst for bohemianism and activism in various social and political
                arenas, fuelling movements such as women's liberation, gay liberation and environmentalism.
                According to Peter Lavezzoli, after the "more popular than Jesus" controversy in 1966, the Beatles felt
                considerable pressure to say the right things and "began a concerted effort to spread a message of
                wisdom and higher consciousness".</P>

           <p> Other commentators such as Mikal Gilmore and Todd Leopold have traced the inception of their socio-cultural
            impact earlier, interpreting even the Beatlemania period, particularly on their first visit to the US, as a
            key moment in the development of generational awareness. Referring to their appearance on the Ed Sullivan
            Show Leopold states: "In many ways, the Sullivan appearance marked the beginning of a cultural revolution
            ... The Beatles were like aliens dropped into the United States of 1964. According to Gilmore:</p>

            <p> Elvis Presley had shown us how rebellion could be fashioned into eye-opening style; the Beatles were
                showing us how style could have the impact of cultural revelation – or at least how a pop vision might
                be forged into an unimpeachable consensus.

                Established in 2009, Global Beatles Day is an annual holiday on 25 June each year that honours and
                celebrates the ideals of the Beatles.[450] The date was chosen to commemorate the date the group
                participated in the BBC programme Our World in 1967, performing "All You Need Is Love" broadcast to an
                international audience</p>
